👋 Welcome to my Machine Learning Sound Exploration Project!
==================================================

🔍 In this project, I've designed a system for analyzing sounds that could be adapted for industrial use, particularly in detecting machinery wear and tear.

🎶 The goal was to create a model that identifies variations in machine sounds and associates them with different conditions. Starting from rhythmic sound samples, I walked through the entire process from data preparation to the implementation and evaluation of a machine learning model.

💡 Using **Librosa**, I extracted relevant audio features, then leveraged clustering techniques to uncover patterns. Finally, I trained a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, which performed remarkably well. This success made more complex models, like CNNs, unnecessary for the project's scope.

📝 In the PDF, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of the methods used and the results achieved. If you're curious about how sound analysis can revolutionize industrial maintenance, you're in the right place!

💻 I've also included the `.ipynb` notebook with the open-source code, so you can explore and experiment with the project yourself!
